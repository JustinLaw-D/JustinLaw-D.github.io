Welcome to my homepage! Here, you can find the various projects that I've worked on over the years, along with all the normal boring stuff (papers, CV, teaching, contact information, etc.).

I'm currently a master's student in mathematics at UBC, studying under <a href='https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~ollivier/'>Rachel Ollivier</a> and <a href='https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cautis/'>Sabin Cautis</a>. I work on computing rigid dualizing complexes for various algebras relevant to representation theory, with an eye towards applications to the mod p local Langlands program.

Outside of work you can find me bouldering, playing DND, having minor heart attacks watching the Leafs come playoff time, or finding new and exciting ways to cook pasta. I even cook other things occasionally, and sometimes they're good!

My CV can be found <a href="/../assets/pdf/cv.pdf" download>here</a>. If you are my student, please contact me via <a href="mailto:justin@math.ubc.ca">this email</a>, not the one in my CV.

Feel free to contact me about any of the projects or papers you find here, or for any other reason!
