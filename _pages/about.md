Welcome to my homepage! Here, you can find the various projects that I've worked on over the years, along with all the normal boring stuff (papers, cv, teaching, contact information, etc.).

A little bit about myself : I'm currently a master's student in mathematics at UBC, studying under <a href='https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~ollivier/'>Rachel Ollivier</a> and <a href='https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cautis/'>Sabin Cautis</a>. I tend to work in anything algebra related, but have a deep dark past as a physicist so I occationally find myself doing some more practical math as well.

Outside of work, I'm a recovered book addict, an avid DND player, and spend potentially too much time finding new and exciting ways to cook pasta. I used to be a hockey player as well, but that petered out once I moved into an apartment.

Feel free to contact me about any of the projects or papers you find here, or for any other reason!
