My teaching philosophy is rather simple. For standard courses (i.e. ones for students not going into mathematics), I do my best to teach underlying concepts while minimizing unnecessary background information. For example, I've taught the $$\delta-\epsilon$$ definition of limits in the past by presenting it as a game, and showed students how sometimes it could help when the intuition of "it's where the function looks like it's going" wasn't working for them. As for courses for students interested in further studies in mathematics, well, I haven't taught those yet. My plan is to focus on clarity, whether that be in my own teaching or in student's proofs. After all, I am of the belief that a proof that nobody understands isn't a proof.
