My remaining ties to the physics department resulted in me running two different workshop series for the undergraduate physics society. The first was entirely focused on building up the fundamentals of linear algebra, and applying them to quantum mechanics. For the second, we decided to go with a series of lectures on a variety of topics including fourier series, quantum entanglement, real manifolds, 4-vectors, and computational methods. The compiled notes for both series are linked above.

Of course, I didn't put these together alone. Credit goes to <a href = 'https://physsoc.phas.ubc.ca/about/current-council-3/'>the entire Physsoc team</a>, along with <a href = 'https://mathstodon.xyz/@mra'>Morgan Arnold</a> and <a href = 'https://rioweil.github.io/'>Rio Weil</a>.

<b>Update as of July 2024</b> : I will be running these lectures in the fall once again, with a re-structured curriculum more focused on quantum mechanics rather than just the math itself. The notes will not be updated for this.
