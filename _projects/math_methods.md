When I first began my undergrad, I was already pretty sure that I wanted to work in physics. In Europe that would've been it, I enter into a physics degree and my story ends there. But in North America it's a little different. You're often forced to do a more general first year where you're assigned to a faculty (in my case science) but not a specific degree. It was during this general first year that, free from the shackles of the rote calculation of high school, I began to realize my love for mathematics.

When my first year of study was over, and it was time to declare my major, I hadn't yet let go of that high school idea of being a physicist. As a result, my declared major for what ended up being the next three years of my degree was a combined one in physics and mathematics. I was never an experimentalist, and in my head this was the perfect path to explore physics the way I wanted to; from a more mathematical perspective.

What I wanted was not what I got. The physics courses on offer were stuck in a weird limbo: They couldn't be taught in a mathematically rigourous way since they were for both experimentalists (who didn't even need to take the class covering abstract vector spaces) and theorists, but at the same time they were often covering topics which could be difficult to understand without the requisite mathematical background. The worst offender for this was quantum mechanics, a subject requiring many abstract linear algebra concepts that simply weren't taught to most physics students.

Fast forward a few years to the final year of my degree. By this time, I had fully completed my transition to mathematics (and was a good 80% of the way towards the areas I work in today), but after spending so long in physics my connections to the department ran deep. Some of my friends were on the governing council of the undergraduate physics society, and mentioned to me that they were working on a series of workshops to try and fill the gaps in physics students' mathematical knowledge. I hopped on board the project, and eventually joined the council with the explicit responsibility to lead it to see it completed.

The result of this was two different workshop series. The first was entirely focused on building up the fundamentals of linear algebra, and applying them to quantum mechanics. For the second, we decided to go with a series of lectures on a variety of topics including fourier series, quantum entanglement, real manifolds, 4-vectors, and computational methods. The compiled notes for both series are linked above.

Of course, I didn't put these together alone. Credit goes to <a href = 'https://physsoc.phas.ubc.ca/about/current-council-3/'>the entire Physsoc team</a>, along with <a href = 'https://mathstodon.xyz/@mra'>Morgan Arnold</a> and <a href = 'https://rioweil.github.io/'>Rio Weil</a>.

<b>Update as of July 2024</b> : I will be running these lectures in the fall once again, with a re-structured curriculum more focused on quantum mechanics rather than just the math itself. The notes will not be updated for this.
