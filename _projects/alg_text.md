This is nominally me consolidating my notes in undergraduate algebra, but quickly spiraled into a much larger work. The style of writing is halfway between a (terse) textbook and a set of personal notes.

Note that this is currently a work in progress. There are missing sections in the attached PDF (the current version), some citation issues, along with what I can only assume are copious typos and errors. If you find any, please let me know!

I've also included a list of the references used in the text on this page for your convenience. I can't guarantee the usefulness of any of these sources to you, but they are all available (and more professionally done than this project).
