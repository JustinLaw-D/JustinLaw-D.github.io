In my first year of undergraduate study, I took part in a specialized program at UBC called <a href = 'https://scienceone.ubc.ca/'>Science One</a>. It covers all four of the "core" science subjects: math, physics, chemistry, and biology, and generally covers topics outside the normal curriculum. I then TA'd the course in my second year, specializing in teaching mathematics and physics (I somehow never graded). In the summer proceeding that year, <a href = 'https://rioweil.github.io/'>Rio Weil</a> (a fellow TA) and I decided to put together a set of notes covering the thermodynamics unit of the physics part of the course, as that midterm had notoriously low averages in previous years. The result, linked above, is essentially a mini-textbook, complete with examples, exercises and solutions.
